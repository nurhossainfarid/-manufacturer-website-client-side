                    <p className='text-xl'>There are many ways improve the performance of a React Application. But best focused option is Optimizing performance. Now, we know that what is optimizing performance and how to it improve the performance of a React Application.... <br />
                    To optimize React rendering, you need to make sure that components receive only necessary props. It will let you control the CPU consumption and avoid over-rendering unnecessary features. The solution is to create a functional component that will collect all props and redistribute them to other components. <br />
                    Optimizing application performance is key for developers who are mindful of keeping a userâ€™s experience positive to keep them on an app and engaged.
                    According to research by Akamai, a second delay in load time can cause a 7 percent reduction in conversions, making it imperative for developers to create apps with optimized performance.
                    In React applications, we are guaranteed a very fast UI by default. However, as an application grows, developers may encounter some performance issues.
                    In this guide, we will discuss five important ways to optimize the performance of a React application, including pre-optimization techniques. These include:</p>
